--> Are we representing mean in the diagram? Correct me, if I am wrong, the mean value is shown by dotted lines in the box plot,

--> Just a twist of words, I guess, what you have written is also fine.

Under Observations, in the last line: Is it ok to mention that as loan grades decrease from A to G,
the ratio of the count of "Charged Off" Loans generally increases with respect to the "Fully paid"
Loans.

--> Here also the mean is not shown by a dottedf line in the diagram.
--> Under Observations, the second line you have mentioned: The 25th percentile debt-to-income ratio for 
"Charged Off" loans is lower than that for "Current" and "Fully Paid" loans. 
    Please correct me if I am wrong but isn't the 25th percentile for "Fully Paid" loans is lower than "Charged Off" loans.
