        "1. **Loan Amount Distribution**: Most loans are smaller, with a higher frequency of loans under $20,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most borrowers opt for loans between \\$5,500 and \\$15,000, with a skew towards smaller loan amounts. This could indicate that the company primarily serves middle-market or risk-averse customers who prefer lower debt obligations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Interest Rate Distribution**: Interest rates are between 10% and 15%.\n",
        "\n",
        "A broad pricing strategy is implemented, where most customers are charged between 9.25% and 14.59%, with some exceptions. These rates are likely determined by a risk-based pricing model, associating higher rates with higher-risk borrowers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Loan Status Distribution**: The majority of loans are either fully paid or charged off (defaulted) with a smaller proportion labeled as current.\n",
        "\n",
        "The majority of loans are successfully repaid, indicating that the company's lending criteria and risk management are effective in most cases. However, the 14% charge-off rate suggests room for improvement in credit assessment and risk management to reduce the default rate."
