## General Information
- This project analyses loan data to assist lenders in making better decisions. We have examined factors such as loan amounts, interest rates, and borrower details to uncover patterns that can mitigate the risk of loan defaults.

### Background
Lenders encounter challenges in approving loans that will be entirely repaid. This analysis offers insights into improving loan approval processes by focusing on the factors that contribute to successful loan repayments.

### Business Problem
The main challenge is to reduce the number of defaulted loans. By identifying key trends in the data, lenders can more accurately predict which loans are likely to be repaid.

### Dataset
- **Loan Amounts:** Ranging from $500 to $35,000.
- **Interest Rates:** Ranging from 5.42% to 24.59%.
- **Loan Statuses:** Include Fully Paid, Charged Off, and Current.
- **Other Features:** Employment length, home ownership, loan purpose, etc.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1:** Higher interest rates often lead to higher default rates.
- **Conclusion 2:** Borrowers with longer employment histories are more reliable.
- **Conclusion 3:** Homeowners, especially those with mortgages, are better at repaying loans.
- **Conclusion 4:** Shorter loan terms are more likely to be fully repaid.
